In this code, we ran mlp and cnn networks on the mnist dataset and the goal was to learn how to create these networks.
For the mlp network, we used three layers with the number of neurons of 200, 250, and 100, which resulted in an accuracy of 0.9643 with 20 epochs. 
The cnn network also had 4 layers with stride=1 and an accuracy of 0.9860
